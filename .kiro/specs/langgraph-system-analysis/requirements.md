# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LangGraph Workflow system is a complex multi-agent system for generating high-quality test cases from Figma design files. The system needs comprehensive documentation and analysis to understand its current architecture, implementation status, and design patterns. This analysis will provide a complete understanding of the system's capabilities, components, and integration points.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with the LangGraph Workflow system, I want a comprehensive analysis of the current system architecture, so that I can understand how all components work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the system THEN it SHALL document all major architectural components and their relationships
2. WHEN analyzing the system THEN it SHALL identify all agent nodes and their specific responsibilities
3. WHEN analyzing the system THEN it SHALL document the workflow orchestration patterns and state management
4. WHEN analyzing the system THEN it SHALL identify all external integrations (Figma API, LLM providers, Redis, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want to understand the current implementation status and code organization, so that I can effectively maintain and extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN it SHALL document all implemented modules and their functionality
2. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN it SHALL identify the current state of optimization features (caching, compression, etc.)
3. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN it SHALL document the quality assessment and optimization mechanisms
4. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN it SHALL identify any gaps between documentation and actual implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the system's design patterns and best practices, so that I can contribute effectively to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the design THEN it SHALL document the multi-agent orchestration patterns used
2. WHEN analyzing the design THEN it SHALL explain the state management and persistence strategies
3. WHEN analyzing the design THEN it SHALL document the caching and performance optimization approaches
4. WHEN analyzing the design THEN it SHALL identify the error handling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want to understand the system's capabilities and limitations, so that I can use it effectively for test case generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting the system THEN it SHALL clearly explain the supported input formats and requirements
2. WHEN documenting the system THEN it SHALL document all available API endpoints and their usage
3. WHEN documenting the system THEN it SHALL explain the quality assessment metrics and optimization process
4. WHEN documenting the system THEN it SHALL provide clear examples of typical usage scenarios
